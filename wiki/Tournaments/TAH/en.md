## Ruleset

### General
1. The tournament is open to players living in any Caribbean or Central-American country. The tournament style is a double-elimination bracket.
3. Players will be seeded by Qualifiers Performance based on their average Accuracy.
4. The tournament will take the best of the first 16 entrants.
5. Poor attitude towards other players or tournament staff will result in disqualification (this point applies to staff members as well).
   
### Match rules

1. The tournament is a 1v1 osu!standard match; highest accuracy wins.
2. Scoring will be calculated via **ScoreV1**.
3. The mappool will change in size depending on round, but at a very minimum will contain 4 NoMod, 2 Hidden, 2 HardRock, 3 DoubleTime, 1 FreeMod, and 1 Tiebreaker.
   - FreeMod consists of either Hidden or HardRock, and optionally Flashlight, or DoubleTime. No other mods/combinations of mods may be used (this includes NM).
4. Players can request to use Nightcore instead of DoubleTime, but the opponent must also agree upon the request.
5. Players are allowed one ban per match, further rounds will allow 2 bans per match.
6. Players can pick a warmup with the max length of **four minutes**.
7. `!roll` will determine who will pick the first beatmap.
8. The player with the highest `!roll` score will choose to either have first pick, or first ban. The opponent will be given the remaining option.
9. Players have 15 minutes in every stage to attend their match before a win by default is given to the other player.
10. If the scores are tied, then the beatmap will be skipped and no point(s) will be awarded.

  
#### Tournament structure
1. 5 points to win the match in the Round of 16.
2. 6 points to win the match starting in the Quarterfinals.
